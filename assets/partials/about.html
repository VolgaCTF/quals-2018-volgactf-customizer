<h2>VolgaCTF 2017 Finals regulations</h2>

<p class="lead">In 2017 we have the following quotas for VolgaCTF 2017 Finals:</p>
<ul class="lead">
	<li>5 teams from the Volga Federal District of Russia,</li>
	<li>5 teams from other regions of Russia,</li>
	<li>3 foreign teams.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">We are going to invite top teams (according to VolgaCTF 2017 Quals scoreboard) on the condition that these teams <i>have specified institution of higher education in their profile</i>. If there appears to be several teams coming from the same educational establishment in the list, we will invite <strong>the one having the highest rank</strong> among those teams.</p>

<p class="lead">The board may change these quotas on technical grounds. Also, we may invite up to 3 guest teams by means of additional quota.</p>

<p class="lead">Invitations will be sent to emails specified in teamsâ€™ profiles. It is <strong>crucial</strong> that the team eligible for participation in VolgaCTF 2017 Finals confirms its participation <strong>by Aug 1</strong>.</p>

<p class="lead">The preliminary list of the teams invited to VolgaCTF 2017 Finals will be published on the competition website no later than 14 days after VolgaCTF 2017 Quals is finished.</p>

<p class="lead">Please note that a team will be excluded from this list:</p>
<ul class="lead">
	<li>if a team denies taking part in the competition, or does not provide timely confirmation of participation,</li>
	<li>if a team is unable to cover its travel and accommodation costs (we <strong>do not</strong> provide financial support),</li>
	<li>if more than half of members in a team graduated more than 2 years ago.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead">Should any team be excluded from the preliminary list, the next one of the same quota (according to VolgaCTF 2017 Quals scoreboard) will be invited.</p>

<p class="lead">Last but not least, we have a limit to the number of participants per team, that is <strong>up to 7 members</strong> in each team.</p>
